# FrontEnd

This folder contains the Angular 2 (4) portion of the application.

## src/app

This directory is the heart of the project and contains the various components and services used in the application.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.
